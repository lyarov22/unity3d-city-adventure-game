# City Adventure Game in Unity3D

**City Adventure Game** is an engaging study project developed using Unity3D during my college studies. The game immerses players in a vibrant, voxel-based urban environment, where they navigate through a dynamically simulated cityscape.

### Features

- **Dynamic Urban Environment:**
  - The game world is a bustling city populated with moving vehicles and airplanes, all featuring realistic physics-based movement.
  - Players experience a lively and interactive environment where city elements react according to physical laws, adding depth and realism to the gameplay.

- **Character Movement:**
  - Players control a character who runs through the city, engaging in a quest to collect scattered coins.
  - The character's movement is finely tuned to ensure responsive and smooth navigation through the urban terrain.

- **Voxel Graphics:**
  - The game employs a distinctive voxel art style, creating a visually appealing and unique cityscape.
  - The voxel-based graphics enhance the charm of the game world, offering a retro yet engaging aesthetic.

- **Physics and Interactions:**
  - All moving objects, including cars and airplanes, adhere to advanced physics principles, affecting their speed, direction, and collisions.
  - The gameplay involves interacting with various city elements, adding complexity and excitement to the experience.

- **Comprehensive Gameplay Logic:**
  - The game incorporates a fully functional logic system, governing character interactions, object behaviors, and environmental dynamics.
  - This ensures a cohesive and immersive gameplay experience, where every element contributes to the overall adventure.

### Technology Stack

- **Unity3D:** Utilized for game development, enabling the creation of a sophisticated and interactive 3D environment.
- **Voxel Graphics:** Employed for the distinctive visual style and artistic representation of the game world.
